# Note: No static k8s-manifests/ directory
# Kubernetes resources are generated dynamically by Python code
# This provides:
# - Dynamic configuration based on environment
# - Parameterized resource generation
# - Interactive HTML content embedded in ConfigMaps
# - Environment-specific optimizations (Docker Desktop vs Cloud)
```

### **Why Dynamic Manifest Generation?**

Unlike Scenarios 1 and 2 which use static YAML files, Scenario 3 uses **dynamic manifest generation** because:

1. **Interactive Content:** The HTML dashboard is generated with embedded JavaScript and needs to be customized
2. **Environment Adaptation:** Different NodePort configurations for different Kubernetes environments
3. **Parameterized HPA:** Scaling policies can be adjusted based on cluster capabilities
4. **Resource Optimization:** CPU/memory requests adapted to cluster size
5. **Real-time Configuration:** Load testing parameters embedded in the application

**All Kubernetes resources are created programmatically in `deploy-auto-scaling-hero.py`:**
- Namespace with labels
- ConfigMaps with interactive HTML content
- Deployments with security contexts and resource limits
- Services with environment-specific configurations
- HPA with intelligent scaling policies

## 🔍 **KEY AUTO-SCALING CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED**

### **1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**
```python
# Intelligent HPA configuration
hpa_spec = {
    "minReplicas": 1,
    "maxReplicas": 10,
    "targetCPUUtilization": 50,
    "behavior": {
        "scaleUp": {
            "stabilizationWindow": "30s",
            "policies": [
                {"type": "Percent", "value": 100},  # Double pods
                {"type": "Pods", "value": 2}        # Max 2 at once
            ]
        },
        "scaleDown": {
            "stabilizationWindow": "60s", 
            "policies": [
                {"type": "Percent", "value": 50},   # Remove half
                {"type": "Pods", "value": 1}        # Max 1 at once
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### **2. Resource Requests and Limits**
```python
# Critical for HPA scaling decisions
resources = {
    "requests": {
        "cpu": "100m",    # HPA uses this for percentage calculations
        "memory": "128Mi"
    },
    "limits": {
        "cpu": "500m",    # Prevents runaway processes
        "memory": "256Mi"
    }
}
```

### **3. Scaling Policies and Timing**
```python
# Scale-up: Aggressive response to load
scale_up_policy = {
    "stabilization_window": 30,  # React quickly
    "max_increase": "100%",       # Double pods if needed
    "max_pods_added": 2           # Add max 2 pods per decision
}

# Scale-down: Conservative resource reclamation  
scale_down_policy = {
    "stabilization_window": 60,  # Wait longer before scaling down
    "max_decrease": "50%",        # Remove half pods max
    "max_pods_removed": 1         # Remove max 1 pod per decision
}
```

### **4. Real-time Load Testing**
```python
# Interactive load generation
def generate_load(intensity, duration):
    """
    intensity: 1-100 (percentage of max load)
    duration: seconds to maintain load
    """
    thread_count = max(1, intensity // 10)
    for i in range(thread_count):
        threading.Thread(target=cpu_intensive_work).start()
```

### **5. Scaling Metrics and Monitoring**
```python
# Real-time scaling metrics
def get_scaling_metrics():
    return {
        "current_pods": get_pod_count(),
        "desired_pods": get_hpa_desired_replicas(),
        "cpu_usage": get_average_cpu_usage(),
        "scaling_events": get_recent_scaling_events(),
        "hpa_conditions": get_hpa_status()
    }
```

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Quick Fixes for Common Auto-scaling Issues**

#### **HPA Shows "Unknown" for CPU Metrics?**
```bash
# Check metrics server
kubectl get apiservice v1beta1.metrics.k8s.io -o yaml

# Restart metrics server if needed (Docker Desktop)
kubectl rollout restart deployment/metrics-server -n kube-system

# Wait for metrics to be available
kubectl top pods -n scaling-challenge
```

#### **Pods Not Scaling Up?**
```bash
# Check HPA status
kubectl describe hpa scaling-demo-app-hpa -n scaling-challenge

# Verify resource requests are set
kubectl describe deployment scaling-demo-app -n scaling-challenge | grep -A 5 requests

# Check current CPU usage
kubectl top pods -n scaling-challenge
```

#### **Interactive Dashboard Not Loading?**
```bash
# Check service and pods
kubectl get svc,pods -n scaling-challenge

# Try port-forward
kubectl port-forward svc/scaling-demo-service -n scaling-challenge 8080:80
# Access: http://localhost:8080

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs -l app=scaling-demo-app -n scaling-challenge
```

#### **Load Testing Not Triggering Scaling?**
```bash
# Verify load test is creating CPU load
kubectl top pods -n scaling-challenge

# Check HPA events
kubectl get events -n scaling-challenge | grep HPA

# Manual load test
python3 load-test.py chaos --intensity 80 --duration 120
```
