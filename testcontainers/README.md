# TestContainers Workshop

**Master the art of testing with real infrastructure through hands-on labs that will transform how you think about testing applications.**

## 🌟 What is TestContainers?

TestContainers is a revolutionary testing library that brings the power of **real infrastructure** to your test suite. Instead of mocking databases, APIs, and services, TestContainers spins up actual containers (PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, etc.) for your tests, giving you:

- **Real behavior** - Tests run against actual databases, not mocks
- **Perfect isolation** - Each test gets a fresh, clean environment
- **Production parity** - Same behavior in tests as in production
- **Zero configuration** - Automatic setup and teardown
- **Cross-platform** - Works identically on any machine

### The W5HH Principle of TestContainers

**Why?** Because mocks lie. They don't catch real integration issues, database constraints, or network problems that break in production.

**What?** Real database containers that behave exactly like production systems, with automatic lifecycle management.

**When?** Every time you write tests that involve databases, APIs, or external services.

**Where?** In your test suite, running alongside your unit tests, providing integration testing capabilities.

**Who?** Every developer who wants reliable, production-like tests that actually catch real-world issues.

**How?** Through simple Python APIs that manage Docker containers automatically.

**How much?** Minimal overhead - containers start in seconds and clean up automatically.

## 🎯 What You'll Master

### **Core Concepts**
- **Real database testing** with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, and MongoDB
- **TestContainers fundamentals** - container lifecycle management
- **Test isolation** - fresh environments for every test
- **Productilson parity** - same behavior across all environments

### **Advanced Patterns**
- **Multi-database coordination** and cross-service communication
- **API testing** with database backends and caching
- **Microservices testing** strategies
- **Performance testing** with realistic data loads
- **Real-world scenarios** - e-commerce systems, monitoring, analytics

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **Testcontainer Desktop** 
- **Docker Desktop** 

## 🎯 Two-File Learning Approach

Each lab has **two files** for maximum learning impact:

### **📚 Working Examples** (`lab1_postgresql_basics.py`)
- **Clean, working code** that builds confidence
- **Step-by-step demos** that always work
- **Perfect for beginners** - no surprises
- **15-20 minutes** of focused learning

### **💥 Chaos Scenarios** (`lab1_postgresql_chaos.py`)
- **Real-world failures** and how to handle them
- **Version conflicts, connection issues, data corruption**
- **Production-like problems** you'll actually face
- **Builds resilience** and problem-solving skills

### **Why This Works:**
1. **Confidence First** - Working examples build confidence
2. **Reality Check** - Chaos scenarios prepare for production
3. **Creator Level** - You understand both success and failure
4. **15-20 Minutes** - Each file is focused and digestible

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Setup (One Command)

```bash
# Navigate to testcontainers directory
cd testcontainers

# One-command setup (creates venv + installs dependencies)
python setup.py
# or
python3 setup.py
```

### Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
source venv-testcontainers/bin/activate

# Windows
venv-testcontainers\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Run Labs

```bash
# Run clean working examples (builds confidence)
python labs/basics/lab1_postgresql_basics.py
python3 labs/basics/lab1_postgresql_basics.py

# Run chaos scenarios (real-world failures)
python labs/basics/lab1_postgresql_chaos.py
python3 labs/basics/lab1_postgresql_chaos.py

# When done, deactivate
deactivate
```
