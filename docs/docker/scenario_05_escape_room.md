# üß© The Storyline

---

You and your workshop friends have been **kidnapped by Dr. NullPointer, the evil villain of the cloud.**  

He‚Äôs locked you inside the **Docker Vault**, a high-security digital prison guarded by containers.

To escape, you must:

- Solve five Docker puzzles
- Discover hidden secrets
- Hack your way through broken networks
- Outsmart containers with memory issues
- Master multi-stage builds to save your digital life!

Fail‚Ä¶and you‚Äôll be trapped running endless `hello-world` containers for eternity.

# üïπÔ∏è The Five Docker Puzzles

---

## ‚≠ê Puzzle 1 ‚Äî The Secret Vault (Volumes)

---

### Dr. NullPointer‚Äôs Message:

> ‚ÄúMwahaha! I‚Äôve hidden the **Escape Key** inside a secret volume.  
> It‚Äôs buried in:
> ```
> /secret/code.txt
> ```
> Inside a Docker volume called:
> ```
> vault-volume
> ```
> Find it‚Ä¶ or you‚Äôll be stuck in `/dev/null` forever.‚Äù

---

### What Learners Must Do

Run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v vault-volume:/mnt busybox cat /mnt/secret/code.txt
````

‚úÖ Copy secret code ‚Üí paste into web UI

---

### Dr. NullPointer Taunts:

* ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs adorable‚Ä¶ you think you can just `docker run` your way out?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúEven my cat knows how to mount a volume.‚Äù

---

‚úÖ Insight:

> ‚ÄúVolumes persist data across containers. They‚Äôre like hidden treasure chests in Docker.‚Äù

---

---

## ‚≠ê Puzzle 2 ‚Äî The Broken Bridge (Networking)

---

### Dr. NullPointer‚Äôs Message:

> ‚ÄúYour precious app can‚Äôt talk to its database!
> I‚Äôve trapped them in **different Docker networks.**
> Fix it‚Ä¶ or your packets will wander the void!‚Äù

---

### Scenario:

* Redis running in `networkA`
* Flask app running in `networkB`

---

### What Learners Must Do

Run:

```bash
docker network connect networkA redis-server
```

‚úÖ Test connectivity:

```bash
docker run --rm --network networkA redis redis-cli -h redis-server ping
```

‚úÖ Enter ‚ÄúPONG‚Äù into web UI ‚Üí unlocks next puzzle

---

### Dr. NullPointer Taunts:

* ‚ÄúPackets? Lost. Like your hopes.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúNetwork errors are my love language.‚Äù

---

‚úÖ Insight:

> ‚ÄúCustom Docker networks let containers talk to each other.
> Default bridge networks isolate them unless connected explicitly.‚Äù

---

---

## ‚≠ê Puzzle 3 ‚Äî The Out-of-Memory Monster

---

### Dr. NullPointer‚Äôs Message:

> ‚ÄúOops‚Ä¶ your container **ran out of memory.**
> It keeps crashing with:
>
> ```
> Cannot allocate memory
> ```
>
> Increase its memory limit‚Ä¶ or I‚Äôll throttle you!‚Äù

---

### What Learners Must Do

Re-run the failing container:

```bash
docker run -d --memory=512m busybox sh -c "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=1M"
```

‚úÖ Check logs:

```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```

‚úÖ Submit confirmation of successful run.

---

### Dr. NullPointer Taunts:

* ‚ÄúMemory? You humans are always running out of it.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúOOM Killer is my best friend.‚Äù

---

‚úÖ Insight:

> ‚ÄúDocker lets you set memory and CPU limits.
> It‚Äôs like giving containers strict lunch money.‚Äù

---

---

## ‚≠ê Puzzle 4 ‚Äî Secrets in Plain Sight

---

### Dr. NullPointer‚Äôs Message:

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôve hidden my evil flag as an **environment variable** inside a running container:
>
> ```
> SECRET_FLAG=escape_docker
> ```
>
> Find it‚Ä¶ or your logs will overflow!‚Äù

---

### What Learners Must Do

Run:

```bash
docker inspect container123
```

‚úÖ Locate environment variable:

```
SECRET_FLAG=escape_docker
```

‚úÖ Submit ‚Äúescape\_docker‚Äù in web UI.

---

### Dr. NullPointer Taunts:

* ‚ÄúNice try. I‚Äôve hidden secrets deeper than your debugging skills.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúInspect me all you want. You‚Äôll never escape.‚Äù

---

‚úÖ Insight:

> ‚Äú`docker inspect` reveals a container‚Äôs secrets:
> environment variables, mount paths, networks, and more.‚Äù

---

---

## ‚≠ê Puzzle 5 ‚Äî The Multi-Stage Finale

---

### Dr. NullPointer‚Äôs Message:

> ‚ÄúFinal door awaits!
> Your challenge:
>
> * Build the smallest possible Docker image for a Go app.
> * Must be under 20MB.
>
> Fail‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôll flood your CI logs forever!‚Äù

---

### What Learners Must Do

Craft this Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp .

FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
ENTRYPOINT ["/myapp"]
```

‚úÖ Build:

```bash
docker build -t escape-final .
```

‚úÖ Submit image size via:

```bash
docker images escape-final
```

‚úÖ Must be under 20MB ‚Üí win the game

---

### Dr. NullPointer Taunts:

* ‚ÄúA big-size image is a slow image.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúMulti-stage builds? Cute. Let‚Äôs see if you can actually do it.‚Äù

---

‚úÖ Insight:

> ‚ÄúMulti-stage builds keep images tiny by copying only what you need into a clean runtime image.‚Äù

## Puzzle Shell Scripts

Each script:

* Sets up puzzle
* Prints puzzle clue
* Prepares containers

Example puzzle1\_volume.sh:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
docker volume create vault-volume
docker run --rm -v vault-volume:/mnt busybox sh -c "echo 'escape123' > /mnt/secret/code.txt"
```

---

## Web UI

* Flask-based
* Renders puzzle clues
* Accepts answer submissions
* Tracks:

  * progress
  * score
  * time left
* Randomly selects villain taunts

---

## Cleanup Script

```bash
docker volume rm vault-volume
docker network rm networkA networkB
docker rm -f container123 app db
docker rmi escape-final
```
