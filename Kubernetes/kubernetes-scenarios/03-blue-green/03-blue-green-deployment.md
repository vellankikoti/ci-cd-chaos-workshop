**Time**: 15-20 minutes | **Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# 1. Kubernetes cluster running
kubectl cluster-info

# 2. Install Python dependencies (Flask only!)
cd hero-solution
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Deploy Blue-Green App (The Easy Way)

```bash
# ONE command for complete blue-green setup
python3 deploy.py
```

**The script will output ready-to-copy commands!** Look for:

```
üîÑ SWITCH BETWEEN VERSIONS:

   # Switch to GREEN (v2.0)
   python3 switch.py green

   # Switch to BLUE (v1.0)
   python3 switch.py blue

   # Check current version
   python3 switch.py status
```

**Copy and paste the commands from the output!** They include:
- ‚úÖ Port-forward command for the app
- ‚úÖ Version switching commands
- ‚úÖ Status check commands
- ‚úÖ Verification commands

**Result**: Both blue (v1.0) and green (v2.0) versions running, with instant switching capability!

> **üí° Pro Tip:** The deployment script outputs everything you need. No need to memorize commands - just copy and paste!

## üéÆ The Blue-Green Experience

### What is Blue-Green Deployment?

Blue-green deployment is a strategy where you run **two identical production environments**:

- **BLUE** = Current version (v1.0)
- **GREEN** = New version (v2.0)

At any time, only ONE is live (receiving traffic). You can switch between them **instantly** with **zero downtime**.

### How It Works

```
1. Initial State:
   BLUE (v1.0) ‚Üê ACTIVE (all traffic)
   GREEN (v2.0) ‚Üê STANDBY (no traffic, but running)

2. Deploy new code to GREEN
   BLUE (v1.0) ‚Üê ACTIVE
   GREEN (v2.0-NEW) ‚Üê STANDBY (test it!)

3. Switch traffic to GREEN
   BLUE (v1.0) ‚Üê STANDBY (instant rollback available!)
   GREEN (v2.0-NEW) ‚Üê ACTIVE (all traffic)

4. If GREEN has issues:
   ‚Üí Instant rollback to BLUE (one command!)
```

### Interactive Demo

```bash
# 1. Deploy both versions
python3 deploy.py

# 2. Open app in browser
http://localhost:31006

# 3. Check current status
python3 switch.py status
# Shows: BLUE is ACTIVE

# 4. Switch to GREEN (zero downtime!)
python3 switch.py green
# Refresh browser - now shows GREEN gradient!

# 5. Switch back to BLUE (instant rollback!)
python3 switch.py blue
# Refresh browser - back to BLUE gradient!
```

**Watch the magic:** Keep refreshing the browser while switching - **zero errors, zero downtime!**

---

## üîç Understanding the Strategy

### The Key Components

#### 1. **Two Identical Deployments**
```yaml
# Blue Deployment (v1.0)
metadata:
  name: blue-deployment
  labels:
    version: blue

# Green Deployment (v2.0)
metadata:
  name: green-deployment
  labels:
    version: green
```

Both deployments are **always running** - this is the secret to zero downtime!

#### 2. **Service with Dynamic Selector**
```yaml
# Service controls which version gets traffic
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: demo-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: demo-app
    version: blue  # ‚Üê Change this to 'green' to switch!
```

**The magic:** Change `version: blue` to `version: green` and traffic **instantly** routes to green pods!

#### 3. **Instant Switching**
```bash
# This command changes the service selector
kubectl patch service demo-app -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'

# Result: All traffic now goes to green pods
# Blue pods still running (ready for rollback!)
```

### The Workflow

```
Deploy ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Switch ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Rollback if needed

1. Deploy GREEN (new version)
   ‚úì Pods start up
   ‚úì Health checks pass
   ‚úì NO TRAFFIC yet

2. Test GREEN
   ‚úì Port-forward to green pods
   ‚úì Run tests
   ‚úì Verify everything works

3. Switch to GREEN
   ‚úì Change service selector
   ‚úì Traffic instantly routes to green
   ‚úì Zero downtime!

4. Verify GREEN
   ‚úì Monitor logs
   ‚úì Check metrics
   ‚úì Watch for errors

5. Rollback if needed
   ‚úì One command: python3 switch.py blue
   ‚úì Instant rollback!
   ‚úì Green stays running for debugging
```

## üìä Verify Blue-Green Deployment

### Check Both Versions Running
```bash
# See all pods with version labels
kubectl get pods -n blue-green-demo -L version

# Output:
# NAME                     READY   STATUS    VERSION
# blue-deployment-xxx      1/1     Running   blue
# blue-deployment-yyy      1/1     Running   blue
# blue-deployment-zzz      1/1     Running   blue
# green-deployment-aaa     1/1     Running   green
# green-deployment-bbb     1/1     Running   green
# green-deployment-ccc     1/1     Running   green
```

### Check Which Version Is Active
```bash
# Check service selector
kubectl get service demo-app -n blue-green-demo -o yaml | grep version

# Or use our helper
python3 switch.py status
```

### Test Each Version Directly
```bash
# Test BLUE directly (bypass service)
kubectl port-forward -n blue-green-demo deploy/blue-deployment 8081:8080
curl http://localhost:8081/health

# Test GREEN directly
kubectl port-forward -n blue-green-demo deploy/green-deployment 8082:8080
curl http://localhost:8082/health
```

## üéØ Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Zero-Downtime Switch

**Goal:** Experience true zero-downtime deployment

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run continuous requests
while true; do
  curl -s http://localhost:31006/health | jq .version
  sleep 0.5
done

# Terminal 2: Switch versions
python3 switch.py green

# Observe: NO FAILED REQUESTS during switch!
```

### Exercise 2: Instant Rollback

**Goal:** Practice instant rollback

```bash
# 1. Switch to green
python3 switch.py green

# 2. "Oh no, there's a bug!" - Rollback!
python3 switch.py blue

# Observe: Instant rollback, zero downtime
```

### Exercise 3: Canary-Style Testing

**Goal:** Use blue-green for canary testing

```bash
# 1. Scale green to 1 pod (10% of traffic if you switch)
kubectl scale deployment green-deployment -n blue-green-demo --replicas=1

# 2. Switch to green (now only 1 pod serves traffic)
python3 switch.py green

# 3. Monitor for issues
kubectl logs -n blue-green-demo -l version=green -f

# 4. If good, scale up green
kubectl scale deployment green-deployment -n blue-green-demo --replicas=3

# 5. If bad, instant rollback
python3 switch.py blue
```

## üéì Blue-Green vs Other Strategies

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Blue-Green | Rolling Update | Canary |
|---------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Downtime** | Zero | Zero | Zero |
| **Speed** | Instant | Gradual | Gradual |
| **Rollback** | Instant | Manual | Manual |
| **Resource Usage** | 2x (both running) | 1.5x (overlap) | 1.1x (small overlap) |
| **Risk** | Low (instant rollback) | Medium | Low (gradual) |
| **Complexity** | Simple | Simple | Medium |
| **Database** | Must be compatible | Must be compatible | Must be compatible |

### When to Use Blue-Green

**‚úÖ Use Blue-Green When:**
- Zero downtime is critical
- Instant rollback capability needed
- You can afford 2x resources
- Database schema is backward compatible
- Application is stateless

**‚ùå Don't Use Blue-Green When:**
- Resources are very limited
- Database migrations are complex
- Application has lots of state
- Testing in production not allowed

## üîê Security & Best Practices

### Implemented in Demo

‚úÖ **Non-root containers** (UID 1000)
‚úÖ **Read-only root filesystem**
‚úÖ **Dropped all capabilities**
‚úÖ **Resource limits** enforced
‚úÖ **Health checks** (liveness & readiness)
‚úÖ **Security contexts** configured

### Production Best Practices

1. **Pre-Deployment Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test green before switching
   kubectl port-forward deploy/green-deployment 8080:8080
   # Run full test suite against localhost:8080
   ```

2. **Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   # Use backward-compatible migrations
   # Example: Add column, deploy code, remove old column
   ```

3. **Monitoring During Switch**
   ```bash
   # Watch error rates, latency, throughput
   # Auto-rollback if metrics degrade
   ```

4. **Gradual Traffic Shift**
   ```bash
   # Use service mesh for weighted routing
   # 10% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100% to green
   ```

---

## üßπ Cleanup

```bash
# Delete everything
kubectl delete namespace blue-green-demo

# Remove generated file
rm k8s-deployed.yaml
```
