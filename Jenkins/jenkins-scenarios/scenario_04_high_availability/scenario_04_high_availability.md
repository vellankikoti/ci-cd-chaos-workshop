# 🚀 High Availability & Disaster Recovery
**5 Minutes - The DevOps Professional's Resilience Strategy**

*"In production, downtime is not an option. 99.9% uptime means 8.76 hours of downtime per year. 99.99% means 52 minutes. The difference? $2M in lost revenue."*

## 🎯 **The Professional's Challenge**

**Real-world scenario:** You're managing a mission-critical e-commerce platform:
- 💰 **$10M+ revenue/day**
- 👥 **1M+ active users**
- 🛒 **50,000+ transactions/hour**
- 🚨 **1 minute of downtime = $7,000 lost**

**The problem:** Traditional deployments cause downtime. Single points of failure cause outages.

**Your mission:** Build a system that never goes down, even during deployments and disasters.

## 🚀 **Quick Start (30 seconds)**

```bash
# 1. Create HA Pipeline Job
# New Item → Pipeline → Name: "high-availability-deployment"
# Pipeline script from SCM → Git
# Repository: https://github.com/vellankikoti/ci-cd-chaos-workshop.git
# Branch: */docker-test
# Script Path: Jenkins/jenkins-scenarios/scenario_04_high_availability/Jenkinsfile

# 2. Run HA Pipeline
# Click "Build Now"
# Watch zero-downtime deployment magic
```

## 🎪 **The 5-Minute Masterclass**

### **Minute 1: Blue-Green Deployment Strategy** ⏱️
**What you'll learn:** Deploy without downtime

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    // High availability options
    options {
        timeout(time: 90, unit: 'MINUTES')           // HA deployments take time
        timestamps()                                  // Audit trail
        ansiColor('xterm')                           // Clear status
        buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '100')) // Keep HA history
        skipDefaultCheckout()                         // Secure checkout
    }
    
    // HA environment variables
    environment {
        APP_NAME = 'ha-microservice'
        BLUE_ENVIRONMENT = 'blue'
        GREEN_ENVIRONMENT = 'green'
        LOAD_BALANCER = 'nginx-lb'
        HEALTH_CHECK_URL = '/health'
        TRAFFIC_SPLIT = '100'  // Percentage to new environment
    }
}
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** "Blue-green deployment is like having two identical houses. You renovate one while living in the other, then switch when ready."

### **Minute 2: Health Checks & Monitoring** ⏱️
**What you'll learn:** Know your system's health before it fails

```groovy
stage('🔍 Pre-Deployment Health Check') {
    steps {
        script {
            echo "🔍 Running comprehensive health checks..."
            
            // Check current environment health
            sh '''
                echo "📊 Current Environment Health:"
                echo "  • Blue environment: HEALTHY"
                echo "  • Green environment: HEALTHY"
                echo "  • Load balancer: ACTIVE"
                echo "  • Database: CONNECTED"
                echo "  • Cache: RESPONSIVE"
                echo "  • External APIs: AVAILABLE"
            '''
            
            // Performance metrics
            sh '''
                echo "📈 Performance Metrics:"
                echo "  • Response time: 45ms (target: <100ms)"
                echo "  • Throughput: 2,500 req/s (target: >2,000)"
                echo "  • Error rate: 0.01% (target: <0.1%)"
                echo "  • CPU usage: 65% (target: <80%)"
                echo "  • Memory usage: 70% (target: <85%)"
            '''
            
            echo "✅ All health checks passed - ready for deployment"
        }
    }
}
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** "Health checks are your early warning system. Catch problems before users do."

### **Minute 3: Zero-Downtime Deployment** ⏱️
**What you'll learn:** Deploy like a magician

```groovy
stage('🚀 Blue-Green Deployment') {
    steps {
        script {
            echo "🚀 Starting zero-downtime deployment..."
            
            // Deploy to inactive environment
            sh '''
                echo "🔵 Deploying to BLUE environment..."
                echo "  • Building new version"
                echo "  • Deploying to blue cluster"
                echo "  • Running smoke tests"
                echo "  • Validating configuration"
                echo "✅ Blue environment ready"
            '''
            
            // Switch traffic gradually
            sh '''
                echo "🔄 Switching traffic to BLUE..."
                echo "  • 10% traffic to blue (monitoring)"
                echo "  • 90% traffic to green (stable)"
                echo "  • Monitoring error rates..."
                echo "  • Checking performance metrics..."
                echo "✅ 10% traffic switch successful"
            '''
            
            // Full traffic switch
            sh '''
                echo "🟢 Full traffic switch to BLUE..."
                echo "  • 100% traffic to blue"
                echo "  • 0% traffic to green"
                echo "  • Final health validation"
                echo "  • Performance verification"
                echo "✅ Full traffic switch successful"
            '''
        }
    }
}
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** "Gradual traffic switching catches issues before they affect all users. 10% failure is better than 100% failure."

### **Minute 4: Disaster Recovery & Rollback** ⏱️
**What you'll learn:** When things go wrong, fix them fast

```groovy
stage('🔄 Disaster Recovery & Rollback') {
    steps {
