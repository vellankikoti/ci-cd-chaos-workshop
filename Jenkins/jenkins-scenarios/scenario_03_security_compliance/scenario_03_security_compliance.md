# 🛡️ Security & Compliance
**5 Minutes - The DevOps Professional's Security Arsenal**

*"In production, security isn't optional. It's not a feature. It's not an afterthought. It's the foundation everything else is built on."*

## 🎯 **The Professional's Challenge**

**Real-world scenario:** You're deploying a financial services application that handles:
- 💰 **$1M+ transactions/day**
- 🔐 **PCI DSS compliance** required
- 🏛️ **SOX compliance** mandatory
- 🚨 **Security breach** = $50M+ in fines

**The problem:** Traditional security is reactive. You find vulnerabilities AFTER they're exploited.

**Your mission:** Build security INTO your pipeline, not ON TOP of it.

## 🚀 **Quick Start (30 seconds)**

```bash
# 1. Create Security Pipeline Job
# New Item → Pipeline → Name: "security-compliance-pipeline"
# Pipeline script from SCM → Git
# Repository: https://github.com/vellankikoti/ci-cd-chaos-workshop.git
# Branch: */docker-test
# Script Path: Jenkins/jenkins-scenarios/scenario_03_security_compliance/Jenkinsfile

# 2. Run Security Pipeline
# Click "Build Now"
# Watch the security arsenal in action
```

## 🎪 **The 5-Minute Masterclass**

### **Minute 1: Secrets Management** ⏱️
**What you'll learn:** Never hardcode secrets again

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    // Security-first options
    options {
        timeout(time: 60, unit: 'MINUTES')           // Security scans take time
        timestamps()                                  // Audit trail
        ansiColor('xterm')                           // Clear security status
        buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '50')) // Keep security reports
        skipDefaultCheckout()                         // Secure checkout
    }
    
    // Secure environment variables
    environment {
        // These come from Jenkins credentials store
        DATABASE_PASSWORD = credentials('database-password')
        API_KEY = credentials('api-key')
        SSL_CERT = credentials('ssl-certificate')
        ENCRYPTION_KEY = credentials('encryption-key')
    }
}
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** "I've seen $2M breaches from hardcoded secrets. Jenkins credentials store is your first line of defense."

### **Minute 2: SAST - Static Application Security Testing** ⏱️
**What you'll learn:** Find vulnerabilities before they're deployed

```groovy
stage('🔍 SAST - Static Security Analysis') {
    steps {
        script {
            echo "🔍 Running Static Application Security Testing..."
            
            // Code quality and security analysis
            sh '''
                echo "📊 SAST Analysis Results:"
                echo "  • OWASP Top 10 scan: PASSED"
                echo "  • SQL injection check: PASSED"
                echo "  • XSS vulnerability scan: PASSED"
                echo "  • Hardcoded secrets scan: PASSED"
                echo "  • Dependency vulnerability: 2 medium, 0 high"
                echo "  • Code complexity: ACCEPTABLE"
                echo "  • Security hotspots: 3 (low priority)"
            '''
            
            // In real production, you'd use tools like:
            // - SonarQube with security plugins
            // - Checkmarx
            // - Veracode
            // - Snyk Code
            
            echo "✅ SAST scan completed - no critical vulnerabilities"
        }
    }
}
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** "SAST finds 80% of vulnerabilities before deployment. The other 20% will cost you everything."

### **Minute 3: DAST - Dynamic Application Security Testing** ⏱️
**What you'll learn:** Test running applications like an attacker

```groovy
stage('🎯 DAST - Dynamic Security Testing') {
    steps {
        script {
            echo "🎯 Running Dynamic Application Security Testing..."
            
            // Start application for testing
            sh '''
                echo "🚀 Starting application for security testing..."
                # In real production, you'd start your app here
                echo "✅ Application started on test port"
            '''
            
            // Dynamic security testing
            sh '''
                echo "🔍 DAST Analysis Results:"
                echo "  • OWASP ZAP scan: PASSED"
                echo "  • Authentication bypass: NOT FOUND"
                echo "  • Authorization flaws: NOT FOUND"
                echo "  • Input validation: PASSED"
                echo "  • Session management: SECURE"
                echo "  • Error handling: PROPER"
                echo "  • SSL/TLS configuration: STRONG"
            '''
            
            // In real production, you'd use tools like:
            // - OWASP ZAP
            // - Burp Suite
            // - Nessus
            // - Qualys WAS
            
            echo "✅ DAST scan completed - no critical vulnerabilities"
        }
    }
}
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** "DAST finds what SAST misses. Attackers don't read your code - they attack your running application."

### **Minute 4: Container Security** ⏱️
**What you'll learn:** Secure containers from base image to runtime

```groovy
stage('🐳 Container Security Analysis') {
    steps {
        script {
            echo "🐳 Running Container Security Analysis..."
            
            // Container image security scan
            sh '''
                echo "🔍 Container Security Scan Results:"
                echo "  • Base image vulnerabilities: 0 critical, 2 medium"
                echo "  • Package vulnerabilities: 1 low severity"
                echo "  • Configuration issues: 0"
                echo "  • Secrets in image: NOT FOUND"
                echo "  • Non-root user: CONFIGURED"
                echo "  • Read-only filesystem: ENABLED"
                echo "  • Resource limits: CONFIGURED"
            '''
            
            // Container runtime security
            sh '''
                echo "🛡️ Runtime Security Configuration:"
                echo "  • AppArmor profile: ENABLED"
                echo "  • Seccomp profile: ENABLED"
                echo "  • Network policies: CONFIGURED"
                echo "  • Pod security policies: ENABLED"
                echo "  • Runtime monitoring: ACTIVE"
            '''
            
            // In real production, you'd use tools like:
            // - Trivy
            // - Clair
            // - Anchore
            // - Twistlock
            // - Aqua Security
            
            echo "✅ Container security scan completed"
        }
    }
}
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** "Container security is 3 layers: base image, build process, and runtime. Miss one, and you're vulnerable."

### **Minute 5: Compliance & Reporting** ⏱️
**What you'll learn:** Prove security to auditors and management

```groovy
stage('📋 Compliance & Security Reporting') {
    steps {
        script {
            echo "📋 Generating Compliance Reports..."
            
            // Generate security reports
            sh '''
                echo "📊 Security Compliance Report:"
                echo "  • PCI DSS: COMPLIANT"
                echo "  • SOX: COMPLIANT"
                echo "  • GDPR: COMPLIANT"
                echo "  • HIPAA: COMPLIANT"
                echo "  • ISO 27001: COMPLIANT"
            '''
            
            // Security metrics
            sh '''
                echo "📈 Security Metrics:"
                echo "  • Vulnerability count: 3 (all low severity)"
                echo "  • Security score: 95/100"
                echo "  • Compliance score: 100/100"
                echo "  • Last security audit: PASSED"
                echo "  • Penetration test: SCHEDULED"
            '''
            
            // Generate compliance artifacts
            sh '''
                echo "📄 Generating Compliance Artifacts:"
                echo "  • Security scan report: security-report-${BUILD_NUMBER}.pdf"
                echo "  • Compliance checklist: compliance-${BUILD_NUMBER}.json"
                echo "  • Vulnerability report: vuln-report-${BUILD_NUMBER}.xml"
                echo "  • Audit trail: audit-trail-${BUILD_NUMBER}.log"
            '''
        }
    }
}
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** "Compliance isn't about checking boxes. It's about proving you're secure to people who don't understand security."
