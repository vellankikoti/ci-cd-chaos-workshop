# ðŸš€ Scenario 1 â€“ Building Docker Images in Jenkins

## âœ… Why It Matters

Building Docker images in Jenkins ensures **consistent deployments** and reliable environments for all future phases of your CI/CD pipeline.

> **Chaos Event:**  
> "Docker build fails with: `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon!`"

---

## âœ… What Youâ€™ll Do

âœ… Build a Docker image for your Python app.  
âœ… Learn to pass parameters to Jenkins jobs.  
âœ… See how Jenkins pipelines handle Docker builds.

---

## âœ… How to Run

1. Start Jenkins via Docker:
    ```bash
    docker run -d \
      -p 8080:8080 \
      -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      jenkins/jenkins:lts-docker
    ```

2. Copy this Jenkinsfile into a new pipeline job.

3. Run the job.

---

## âœ… Chaos Fixes

- Mount `/var/run/docker.sock` into your Jenkins container.
- Avoid building Docker images on Jenkins master. Use agents if possible.

---

## âœ… Expected Output

âœ… Console log should show:
````

âœ… Built image: sha256\:xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

```

---

## âœ… Best Practices

- Always tag images with a unique version.
- Keep images minimal for faster builds.
- Clean up old images to save disk space.
