# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Docker Networking Magic ‚Äî Step-by-Step for Everyone!

## ü•á What are we doing?
We're going to run a voting website in Docker, break it in fun ways, and then fix it together! You'll see how computers talk to each other in containers.

## üöÄ Quick Start - Automated Demo

**For a complete automated experience, run:**
```bash
cd Docker/docker-scenarios/scenario_03_networking
./demo_simple.sh
```

**For an interactive demo with explanations, run:**
```bash
cd Docker/docker-scenarios/scenario_03_networking
./demo_manual.sh
```

**For non-interactive demo (for CI/CD), run:**
```bash
cd Docker/docker-scenarios/scenario_03_networking
NON_INTERACTIVE=true ./demo_manual.sh
```

## üìö Step-by-Step Learning Journey

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1: App Without Database (Expected Failure)
**What happens:**
- App starts successfully but has no database
- When you try to vote, it fails
- Demonstrates container isolation

**Learning moment:**
- Containers are isolated by default
- Apps need explicit database connections
- No automatic service discovery

**Key endpoints:**
- `http://localhost:5000` - App accessible but voting fails

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Database in Wrong Network (Expected Failure)
**What happens:**
- Both containers are running
- App tries to connect to Redis by hostname
- But they're in different networks
- Hostname resolution fails

**Learning moment:**
- Docker networks isolate containers
- Containers in different networks can't see each other
- Need explicit network configuration

**Key endpoints:**
- `http://localhost:5000` - App accessible but voting fails

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3: Fix the Network (Success!)
**What happens:**
- Both containers are in the same network
- Hostname resolution works
- Voting functionality works perfectly

**Learning moment:**
- Custom networks enable container communication
- Hostname resolution within same network
- This is how microservices communicate
- Real-world pattern used daily

**Key endpoints:**
- `http://localhost:5000` - Complete working voting system

---

### üéâ Step 4: Complete Working System (Final Success!)
**What happens:**
- Both containers are in the same network (vote-net)
- App can communicate with Redis (hostname resolution works)
- Port is published to host (accessible from your computer)
- This is a production-ready microservices setup!

**Learning moment:**
- This demonstrates all concepts working together in harmony
- Production-ready microservices architecture
- Complete container communication and host access

**Key endpoints:**
- `http://localhost:5000` - Complete working voting system
- Network connectivity tests confirm everything works

---

## üßπ Clean Up

When you're done, clean up everything:

```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```

---

# üéâ That's it! You're a Docker Networking Wizard!

- You saw how apps and databases need to be in the same network.
- You learned how to fix broken connections.
- You learned how port publishing works to access containers from your host.
- You explored Docker networks and saw how isolation works.
- You learned to inspect and debug Docker networking like a pro.
- You built a complete, production-ready microservices system!

---

## üß© Troubleshooting & Debugging Tips

- If a script says "permission denied," run: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
- If you see "port already in use," run: `./scripts/cleanup.sh` and try again.
- Use `docker ps` to see running containers.
- Use `docker logs <container>` to view logs and debug errors.
- Use `docker exec -it <container> /bin/sh` to get a shell inside a container for advanced debugging.
- Use `docker network inspect <network>` to see which containers are connected and their IPs.
- If you want to start over, always run the cleanup script first.
