## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run the Demo (Interactive with Web Dashboards)
```bash
python3 demo.py
```

This launches **3 web applications** for hands-on security learning!

### Cleanup
```bash
python3 cleanup.py
```

## 🎓 What You'll Learn

### Core Security Concepts
- ❌ **Anti-patterns**: What makes Docker containers vulnerable
- ✅ **Secrets management**: Docker secrets and environment variables
- 🔒 **Security hardening**: Non-root users, minimal attack surface
- 🛡️ **Network security**: Container isolation and communication
- 🔍 **Vulnerability scanning**: Security assessment and remediation

### Technical Skills
- Docker secrets management
- Security hardening techniques
- Vulnerability scanning and assessment
- Network security and isolation
- Production-ready security practices

## 🌐 Web Applications

### The demo launches 3 interactive web applications:

| URL | Application | Purpose | Features |
|-----|-------------|---------|----------|
| `http://localhost:8000` | **Security Dashboard** | Real-time security analysis | • Live vulnerability scanning<br>• Security score tracking<br>• Secrets management demo<br>• Auto-refresh metrics |
| `http://localhost:8001` | **Vulnerable App** | Security anti-pattern demo | • Hardcoded secrets exposed<br>• Root user vulnerabilities<br>• Network security risks<br>• Attack surface visualization |
| `http://localhost:8002` | **Secure App** | Security best practices | • Docker secrets integration<br>• Non-root user security<br>• Network isolation<br>• Security benefits |

## 📊 Results You'll See

### Security Comparison
```
Vulnerable Container:  🔴 0% Security Score (❌ Critical vulnerabilities)
Secure Container:      🟢 100% Security Score (✅ Production-ready)
Improvement:            🎯 100% security enhancement
```

### Vulnerability Analysis
```
Vulnerable Issues:     15+ critical vulnerabilities
Secure Issues:         0 vulnerabilities
Security Hardening:    100% improvement
Attack Surface:        90% reduction
```

### Secrets Management
- ✅ **Docker secrets** vs hardcoded credentials
- ✅ **Environment variables** vs plaintext secrets
- ✅ **Network isolation** vs exposed services
- ✅ **User permissions** vs root access

## 🎪 Workshop Features

### Educational Progression
1. **Problem Demonstration** - See vulnerable container being exploited
2. **Solution Implementation** - Watch security hardening in action
3. **Visual Comparison** - Interactive dashboard analysis
4. **Hands-on Exploration** - Try all three applications

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Python 3.6+
- 2GB+ available disk space (temporary)
- Ports 8000, 8001, 8002 available (for interactive demo)

### Dependencies
All Python packages are automatically installed:
- `flask` - Web framework
- `docker` - Docker API integration
- `cryptography` - Security utilities
- `requests` - HTTP client

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Perfect For:
- **Docker security workshops** and training sessions
- **Conference presentations** with live security demos
- **Team training** on security best practices
- **DevOps education** and security awareness
- **Self-learning** Docker security concepts

### Audience:
- **All Levels**: Run `python3 demo.py` - comprehensive with interactive web dashboards
- **Advanced**: Explore the Dockerfiles and security implementation details
- **Trainers**: Use the demo for engaging, hands-on security presentations

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Ports already in use:**
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :8000 -i :8001 -i :8002

# Kill processes if needed
sudo pkill -f "python.*app.py"
```

**Docker build fails:**
```bash
# Clean up Docker
docker system prune -f
docker volume prune -f
```

**Demo interrupted:**
```bash
# Manual cleanup
python3 cleanup.py
```

**Applications not accessible:**
- Wait 5-10 seconds after "starting" messages
- Check Docker containers are running: `docker ps`
- Verify ports aren't blocked by firewall
