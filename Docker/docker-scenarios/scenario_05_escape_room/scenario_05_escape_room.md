## 3. Setup & Start the Game

### **A. Clone and Navigate**
```bash
cd Docker/docker-scenarios/scenario_05_escape_room
```

### **B. Start the Web UI (Auto-Setup!)**

**Recommended: Docker Compose**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
# Open http://localhost:5000
```

**No need to run puzzle setup scripts manually!**
All puzzles are auto-initialized when the app starts.

**Helper scripts:**
- `./reset_game.sh` ‚Äî Reset all puzzles and containers for a fresh start
- `./demo_workshop.sh` ‚Äî 10-minute workshop demo guide

---

## 4. How to Play

1. **Open the web interface** at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
2. **Read Dr. Bug's clues** for each puzzle.
3. **Use your terminal** to run real Docker commands to solve the puzzle.
4. **Submit your answer** in the web UI.
5. **Progress through all 5 puzzles to escape!
6. **Use the 'Start Over' button at any time for a fresh game.**

---

## 5. Puzzle-by-Puzzle Solutions

### ‚≠ê Puzzle 1: The Secret Vault (Volumes)
**Solve:**
```bash
docker run --rm -v vault-volume:/mnt busybox cat /mnt/secret/code.txt
# Copy the code and submit in the web UI
```

---

### ‚≠ê Puzzle 2: The Network Detective
**Solve:**
```bash
docker inspect network-spy | grep IPAddress
# Find the IP and submit in the web UI
```

---

### ‚≠ê Puzzle 3: The Memory Detective
**Solve:**
```bash
docker inspect memory-victim | grep -i memory
# Find the memory limit in MB and submit in the web UI
```

---

### ‚≠ê Puzzle 4: The Secret Hunter
**Solve:**
```bash
docker inspect secret-keeper | grep -A 10 -B 5 SECRET_CODE
# Find the value of SECRET_CODE (docker_master_2025) and submit in the web UI
```

---

### ‚≠ê Puzzle 5: The Image Sleuth (Multi-Stage Build)
**Solve:**
```bash
docker images suspicious-image
# Find the image size in MB and submit in the web UI
```

---

## 6. Cleanup

After playing, clean up all Docker resources:
```bash
./cleanup.sh
# Or manually:
docker-compose down
docker system prune -f
```

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **Permission denied on Docker socket:**  
  `sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock`
- **Port 5000 already in use:**  
  Change port in `docker-compose.yml` or `app.py`
- **Puzzle setup fails:**  
  Ensure Docker is running, run cleanup, and try again.
- **Reset everything:**  
  `./reset_game.sh`

---

## 8. Educational Benefits
- Master Docker volumes, networking, secrets, resource limits, and multi-stage builds.
- Real hands-on troubleshooting and problem-solving.
- Fun, memorable, and practical Docker experience.
